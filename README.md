<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p>The scoring system was created in<a href="https://python.org"> Python </a>as a final project cocluding my first year at college</a>.
  <br><br>
  The Task was to design and develop a scoring system in which event officials could add individual players, add players to teams, add points to players, 
  and display a leaderboard which displays a player's individual total amount of points as well as displaying each teams total amount of points. The
  leaderboard also shows specific details of each individual user such as whether or not they are part of a team, which events they participated in, and amount
  of points gained in each event participated in.
